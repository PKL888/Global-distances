# Global-distances
My first repository on GitHub is a program uses the Haversine Formula to calculate the Great Circle Distance between two cities around the globe.

(Adi : this is an example of a change. I'm committing to the "master" branch, and then pushing)

(Peleg: is this the correct way to commit and push?)

(Peleg: Edited the repository locally and then used GitHub Desktop...)
